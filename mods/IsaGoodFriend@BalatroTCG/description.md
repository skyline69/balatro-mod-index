# Balatro, but as a trading card game!

A new multiplayer mod, fully compatible with the official Multiplayer Mod and Server!

## How does it work?

Build your deck or use a prebuilt deck.  Join a TCG specific lobby and fight your friends!  Buy everything from your hand, and wittle your opponent's money down until they bankrupt.

## Does this use a custom server?

Not anymore!  Thanks to Virtualized for helping me get their server up to date and supporting this mod.

## How does damage even calculate?

Basically the more digits in your final score for the round, the higher your attack.  100 points starts off at 1 damage, and every 10x to that score equals 4 more points of damage.  Or about 1.75x mult equals 1 point of damage.
