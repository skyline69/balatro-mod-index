Adds a bunch of new vanilla-esque jokers that expand your choices in how you play and craft strong builds! All jokers and their art were personally developed by me, with a great amount of dev help from the Balatro Discord #modding-dev channel.

pi_cubed's Jokers is a relatively lightweight mod with minimal lovely patching and hooks. As a result, there should be few crashes due to conflicts with other mods. Feel free to reach out to me via the link above if problems do occur!
