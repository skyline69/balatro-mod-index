A Binding of Isaac-inspired mod, aiming to be balanced around vanilla.

Includes 2 new types of cards: Actives and Trinkets! They both have their own area and have a variety of effects.

Also includes Jokers, Consumables, Enhancements, Decks, Blinds, Stakes... Stuff that you would expect on content mods.
