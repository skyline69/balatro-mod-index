# Grab Bag
Grab Bag is a Balatro mod that (as of v0.4.11) adds: 
- 46 (+8) Jokers
- 3 Tarots
- 1 Spectral
- 3 Enhancements 
- 15 Boss Blinds
- 5 Showdown Boss Blinds
- and 4 Decks.

The content in this mod is supposed to feel vanilla, and I created this new content to be largely in line with the rules and design philosophy that localthunk follows when making Jokers and other content.
