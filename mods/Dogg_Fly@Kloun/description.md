# Kloun
Kloun is an alternate universe in which more clowns are added to the game as a replacement for jokers and jesters. In this universe, money is important. 
Right now, it's like a demo that adds 22 jokers and a set of consumables, a scoring system with money and etc. If you encounter an error or crash, please report it.
