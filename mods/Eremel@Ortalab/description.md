It's Balatro as you know it, but backwards, and sideways, as if the game was designed in an alternate universe.
Simply put, it's Balatro, backwards!
And thus, Ortalab!

With 150 new jokers, 20 new challenges, 8 new stakes, more than 50 new consumables, and way, WAY, more, Ortalab is practically a sequel to Balatro.

Get ready to find new strategies, blow the game out of the water, and maybe no die to The Plant for once.

Have fun!
