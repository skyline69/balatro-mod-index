# Foolish Dreams : A Pseudoregalia themed mod 
Foolish Dreams is a mod attempting to bring Pseudoregalia to Balatro while trying to keep a certain 'Vanilla feel' to it.

Adds :
- 54 Jokers
- 1 Tarot, 5 Spectral, 2 Enhancements, 5 Boss Blind, 9 Vouchers, 1 Poker Hand

# WARNING
Talisman will crash with some jokers of the mod due to the way Talisman handle calculations and scoring, however you could still use that mod with it as otherwise there's no major crash or issue, works also with Cryptid.
However, i didn't think of the compatibility of other gameplay mods primarily while making this one. So conflicts can be possible.
