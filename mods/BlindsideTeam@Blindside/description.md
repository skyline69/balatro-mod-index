# Blindside
What the HECK is a Blindside?<br>
It's a full spinoff game (mod) for Balatro using the same engine,<br>
running on the SMODS modloader.<br>
## Okay, what's new?
Instead of fighting Blinds, you fight Jokers.<br>
Instead of playing cards, you play...Blinds?!<br>
It's a totally absurd premise with a unique execution.<br>
<br>
This game's content exists alongside Balatro, meaning you can<br>
play a run of Balatro: Blindside, and then go play a normal run<br>
right after on the same save file. The only difference is what<br>
deck you choose to play with.<br>
## Status
Currently in BETA, we are finishing up the content of Blindside.<br>
You can download it in Releases and install it like any other mod.<br>
Updates will feature primarily new content as opposed to reworks.
