# Vanilla+ Decks
A Balatro mod that adds a bunch **new vanilla-style decks**. 
Focussing on creative and game-changing ideas to refresh your runs.

Currently in development of even more decks, you can check the full list on the github repository.

This mod is both in Spanish and English.

## Dice Deck

This deck has the **[Oops! All 6s](https://balatrowiki.org/w/Oops!_All_6s)** effect **naturally** inside it.
Also starts with a *Magician* and a *Justice* card.

## Chips Deck

This deck **gains chips** permanently for each **remaining hand** at the end of round.
But gives **no extra money** per unused hand.

## Negative Deck

This deck starts with **only 2** joker slots.
But turns one random, edition-less joker **negative** at the end of each boss blind.
