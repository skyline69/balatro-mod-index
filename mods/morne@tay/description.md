WELCOME... to MORNE. The ONLY good* Balatro mod.
*OXYMORON, as mods cannot be good.

Made by the finest of Balatro's hating communities, with ideas cooked up straight from the devious minds of Marmo, DUI, and me, Tay. On the sliding scale of hate, there's Marmo at the most, DUI at the middleground, and me, the programmer, at the end. We know we'll make things balanced because we don't try to match the base-game... we try to be BETTER!
