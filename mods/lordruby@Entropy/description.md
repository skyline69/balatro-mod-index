## Wheres all the Other Content?
Due to me wanting to depart from this mod as a Cryptid addon but not wanting the content to go to waste a lot of existing content has been moved into CrossMod territory, where it will only show up if you have Cryptid enabled. This includes entropic Jokers which are based on Exotics

## What about Ascension Power
Ascension Power will stay around even without Cryptid enabled due to how much Entropy content relies on it
I could rename ascension power to further seperate it from Cryptid however I think this is unnecessary as the mechanics will remain the same
