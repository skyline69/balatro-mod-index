# Save Rewinder

**Undo mistakes. Experiment freely. Never lose progress.**

Automatically creates save points as you play, letting you rewind to any recent moment with a single keystroke.

## Features

- **Experiment freely** — Test risky strategies without committing
- **Automatic snapshots** — Creates saves at blind selection, hand play/discard, end of round, and shop
- **Instant restore** — Press `S` to step back, no menus needed
- **Undo your undo** — Rewinded saves stay in the list until you make a new move
- **Full controller support** — L3 to step back, R3 to open saves list

## Save List

Click the **orange "Saves" button** in pause menu or press `Ctrl+S` to open the save browser:

- **Blind icons** — Shows Small/Big/Boss blind image for each save (toggleable)
- **Hover effects** — Animation and sound when hovering over blind icons
